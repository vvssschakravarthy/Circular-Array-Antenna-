The codes are for an 8 element Circular Array of Isotropic Elements and its synthesis using Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization.
Execute the main.m code to start with.
You can tune the simulation and optimization by simply handling the APSO algorithm specific variables and the process variables like number of iterations and population.
