The codes are for an 8 element Circular Array of Isotropic Elements and its synthesis using Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization. Soon code pertaining to SGOA and MSGOA will be published in a separate branch. Keep visiting.
Execute the main.m code to start with.
You can tune the simulation and optimization by simply handling the MSGOA and APSO algorithm specific variables and the process variables like number of iterations and population.
Best way to start with is through apso_main.m
